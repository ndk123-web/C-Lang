# C Programming Learning Repository

Welcome to my C Language Learning Repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains various C programs that I wrote during my early days of learning C programming. These files are mostly focused on writing and practicing code â€” they may not contain detailed comments but the logic is clear through the structure of the code.

---

## ðŸ“š Contents

- Basic Syntax Practice
- Control Statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and Strings
- Pointer Examples
- malloc / calloc Memory Allocation
- Function Implementations
- Small Problem Solving Programs

---

## ðŸ”§ How To Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/ndk123-web/C-Lang.git
```
2. Open the `.c` files in any code editor or C-supported IDE.
3. Compile the programs using GCC or any standard C compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to test and understand the output.

## ðŸ“… Purpose

This repository is created for **personal learning and practice**.
It is focused on building logic and coding structure in C. The code files may not include inline comments, but they were written to reinforce concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

This repository is created for **learning and personal practice purposes** only.
Anyone is free to explore, learn from, and use the code as reference.
However, the code may lack comments and advanced optimizations since it was written purely for practice.
